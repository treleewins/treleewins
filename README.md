## Salutations 👋

My name is Tremaine, I am a social researcher based in Raleigh, NC.

I mostly work on projects that support social science research and data management. The tools that I use currently are R, Python. I have experience with STATA, SAS and SPSS.

I’m currently working on my dissertation proposal which involves using automated web scrapping tools that I construct in both R and Python.
